    content: "**Schnellschuss** (German): *Something that is produced at short notice, without long planning, without thorough preparation (e.g. in response to an unforeseen event)*\n\t\nWith Schnellschuss you can create powerful private enviroments (we call it *shots*) for short term or project dedicated use - in just one command.\n\n### What is a shot?\n\nSome quick facts for you:\n\n- A *shot* is a virtual fully-fledged linux enviroment, hosted in our cloud. \n- It's getting created on demand in under **9 seconds** in just one command.\n- We connect a **1Gbit** shared enterprise ethernet connection to every *shot*. Allowing up- and download speeds up to **120 MB/s** \n- **You** have the full controll over a *shot*. It is a fully fledged server with its own dedicated and public IP-address, enabeling your friends or collages to connect.\n\n### How I can access my shot?\n\n- We offer a command-line interface for MacOS/Linux/Windows\n- There will be also a more fancy a desktop app for MacOS/Linux/Windows with advanced account management features\n- We offer a WebApp with the same functionality as the desktop app\n- Via an Android/iOS App\n\nWe got everything covered!\n\n### Disposable enviroments\n\n#### Testing \n\nYou like to try out new things, want to quickly check how different configurations behave, or just want to make your new webapp accessible to give your friends a look? At the same time you don't want to mess up your lokal system?\n\nWe got the right thing for you!\n\n*Shots* are bringing several benefits compared to local testing enviroments:\n\n- Every enviroment does have it's own puplic and dedicated IP-address - enabling friends and colleagues to e.g. connect to your test enviroment and give you a feedback about the website you just created. It's a real server!\n- Local enviroments produce a lot of waste and may slow down your system if not taken care of. Just leave the cleanup to us! Every testing enviroment is disposed after disconencting from it (only if you wish so! See [Project enviroments](#project enviroments)).\n\nOf course **Docker** is also available and pre-installed on our *shots* - possible faster instantiated due to our fast ehernet conenction. \n\n#### Compensating bad bandwith\n\nWorking with large files is a mess! Especially if you have to share the WiFi with Netflix addicts, or working from coffee shops.\nExtracting this config-file out of your Backup, or checking the output of this new machine learning model can escalate to a long lasting and frustrating journey.\n\nEvery *shot* is providing you with a **1Gbit** (up/download with up to 120MB/s) private enviroment, created in under **9 seconds**. Freshly created on every creation. Just piping console in- and output to your device!\n\n### Project Enviroments\n\nWe also give you the option to keep *shots* running in the background and connect to them later on again. The system stays fully active in the background. Also we offer the possibility to save the current state of the *shot* as a image and create a new *shot* at any given time from this state. This is similiar to shutting down and start your local computer - with the addition of cloning your harddrive to another computer!\n\nEspecially the image-function makes it possible to have your own dedicated and isolated project enviroment in the cloud - instantiated and ready in under **9 seconds**. \n\n#### Some use cases\n\n- Quickly instantiate your personal picture-backup image, upload the latest pictures via the hosted web-app you installed yourself earlier (like Nextcloud). Save the state and put it to sleep again.\n\n- Create an webserver enviroment to show the latest progress of your webapp to your friends. Instantiate a *shot* from your configured image, upload the updated files and your ready to show off!\n\n- Working on larger and more time intensive projects, like configuring a mailserver or a specific software enviroment. Save the image, go to sleep and put everythign up again in the morning!\n\n### Images\n\nWe already told you how you can use images for project enviroments in the [Project Enviroments section](#project enviroments). Now we tell you more details about it.\n\n#### Flexibility\n\nAt any time you can clone your image and see how it performs with a changed configuration or middleware. See this a s a branch of your GitHub Repositiory for your *shot*!\n\nYou can create an unlimited amount of instances from your image \n\n#### Sharing is caring\n\nIt's possible to share your private images with your friends - see this as a fork of your GitHub repository for your *shot*!\n\nThis makes it easy to work together on server projects with your friends, colleagues or even the *Schnellschuss* community.\n\n#### Make it permanent\n\nOnce you finished your project, we offer you to host the image on a real virtual or dedicated server, putting you into production with just one command!\n\n### Session sharing\n\n*Schnellschuss* offers you two ways how you can conenct to your *shot*:\n\n1. Shared secure end-to-end connection\n2. Direct secure and private end-to-end conenction \n\nYou can freely chose your connection method, depending on your needs.\n\n#### Shared connection\n\nWith the shared connection you have the possibility to work together with friends or colleagues at the same time in the same session! See this as the terminal-version of TeamViewer!\n\n- Decide if you want to share read and additionally write access to your session and share the conenction link or Id. And watch at the same *shot* in real-time.\n- You are able to record your session and use it later on as a documentation or create an interactive Tutorial from!\n- Instantly stream your *shot* output during a presentation, course, webcast, or programming stream! See this as Twitch for your Terminal.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Create a disposable test shot\n\n```console\n[fafre@fafre-20hn002vge ~]$ schnellschuss new disposable\nCreated new shot with IPv4: 192.168.1.1 IPv6: ::ffff:c0a8:101\nroot@ss-36dj9:~# echo hello from shot\nhello from shot\nroot@ss-36dj9:~# exit\nShot has been disposed\n[fafre@fafre-20hn002vge ~]$\n```\n\n#### Resume a shot\n\nThis only works when you connect via a shared conenction.\n\n```console\n[fafre@fafre-20hn002vge ~]$ schnellschuss new disposable --name resume-test --shared\nCreated new shot \"resume-test\" with IPv4: 192.168.1.1 IPv6: ::ffff:c0a8:101\nroot@resume-test:~# export x=shot\nroot@resume-test:~# echo $x\nshot\nroot@resume-test:~# exit --keep-alive\nShot has been put to background\n[fafre@fafre-20hn002vge ~]$ echo $x\n\n[fafre@fafre-20hn002vge ~]$ schnellschuss resume resume-test\nShot \"resume-test\" resumed with IPv4: 192.168.1.1 IPv6: ::ffff:c0a8:101\nroot@resume-test:~# echo $x\nshot\nroot@resume-test:~#\n```\n\n#### Create a project shot\n\n```console\n[fafre@fafre-20hn002vge ~]$ schnellschuss new project\nCreated new shot with IPv4: 192.168.1.1 IPv6: ::ffff:c0a8:101\nroot@ss-36dj9:~# touch newconfig.json\nroot@ss-36dj9:~# exit\nProject hasn't been saved! Enter image name to save: test-project\nShutting down shot...\nCreating image...\n[fafre@fafre-20hn002vge ~]$\n```\n\n#### Resume a project shot from image\n\n```console\n[fafre@fafre-20hn002vge ~]$ schnellschuss new project --from-image test-project\nCreated new shot with IPv4: 192.168.1.1 IPv6: ::ffff:c0a8:101\nroot@ss-36dj9:~# rm newconfig.json\nroot@ss-36dj9:~# exit\nProject hasn't been saved! Enter image name to save: test-project-without-config\nShutting down shot...\nCreating image...\n[fafre@fafre-20hn002vge ~]$\n```\n\n#### Create a shot from docker container\n\n```console\n[fafre@fafre-20hn002vge ~]$ schnellschuss new disposable --from-docker ubuntu:latest\nCreated new shot with IPv4: 192.168.1.1 IPv6: ::ffff:c0a8:101\nroot@ss-36dj9:~# docker run -it ubuntu:latest\nroot@6bd5be2ae8dc:/# exit\nroot@ss-36dj9:~# exit\nShot has been disposed\n[fafre@fafre-20hn002vge ~]$\n```"
