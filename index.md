    content: "**Schnellschuss** (German): *Something that is produced at short notice, without long planning, without thorough preparation (e.g. in response to an unforeseen event)*\n\t\nWith Schnellschuss you can create powerful private enviroments (we call it *shots*) for short term or project dedicated use - in just one command.\n\n### What is a shot?\n\nSome quick facts for you:\n\n- A *shot* is a virtual fully-fledged linux enviroment, hosted in our cloud. \n- It's getting created on demand in under **9 seconds** in just one command.\n- We connect a **1Gbit** shared enterprise ethernet connection to every *shot*. Allowing up- and download speeds up to **120 MB/s** \n- **You** have the full controll over a *shot*. It is a fully fledged server with its own dedicated and public IP-address, enabeling your friends or collages to connect.\n\n### Disposable enviroments\n\n#### Testing \n\nYou like to try out new things, want to quickly check how different configurations behave, or just want to make your new webapp accessible to give your friends a look? At the same time you don't want to mess up your lokal system?\n\nWe got the right thing for you!\n\n*Shots* are bringing several benefits compared to local testing enviroments:\n\n- Every enviroment does have it's own puplic and dedicated IP-address - enabling friends and colleagues to e.g. connect to your test enviroment and give you a feedback about the website you just created. It's a real server!\n- Local enviroments produce a lot of waste and may slow down your system if not taken care of. Just leave the cleanup to us! Every testing enviroment is disposed after disconencting from it (only if you wish so! See [Project enviroments](#project enviroments)).\n\n#### Compensating bad bandwith\n\nWorking with large files is a mess! Especially if you have to share the WiFi with Netflix addicts, or working from coffee shops.\nExtracting this config-file out of your Backup, or checking the output of this new machine learning model can escalate to a long lasting and frustrating journey.\n\nEvery *shot* is providing you with a **1Gbit** (up/download with up to 120MB/s) private enviroment, created in under **9 seconds**. Freshly created on every creation. Just piping console in- and output to your device!\n\n### Project Enviroments\n\nWe also give you the option to keep *shots* running in the background and connect to them later on again. The system stays fully active in the background. Also we offer the possibility to save the current state of the *shot* as a image and create a new *shot* at any given time from this state. This is similiar to shutting down and start your local computer - with the addition of cloning your harddrive to another computer!\n\nEspecially the snapshot-function makes it possible to have your own dedicated and isolated project enviroment in the cloud - instantiated and ready in under **9 seconds**. \n\n#### Some use cases\n\n- Quickly instantiate your backup instance, upload the latest picture via the hosted web-app (like Nextcloud), save the state and put it to sleep again.\n\n- Create an webserver enviroment to show the latest progress of your webapp to your friends. Instantiate a *shot* from your configured image, upload the updated files and your ready to show off!\n\n- Working on larger and more time intensive projects, like configuring a mailserver or a specific software enviroment. Save the image, go to sleep and put everythign up again in the morning!\n"
